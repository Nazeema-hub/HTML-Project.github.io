        A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 
        passed-out student.I joined Tap Academy as a
        CSR student in the month of February.
        My journey with Tap Academy is quite different.
        The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced.
        They teach a lot of new concepts and help in 
        learning programming languages from scratch.
        I am from the Computer Science branch, but the
        teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way 
        that makes it easy for students from all domains
        to understand the concepts and technology taught 
        by the trainers.Finally, I got placed as a Software 
        Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. 
        The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
        Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for 
        helping me acquire this opportunity.</pre>

            Enrolling at TAP Academy Institute has been one of the
            best decisions for my educational and professional growth.
            The institute offers a holistic learning environment that
            caters to various aspects of my development as a student 
            and aspiring professional.

            The teachers at TAP Academy are incredibly knowledgeable and
            always willing to help. Their dedication to student success
            is evident in the personalized attention they provide. 
            Whenever I faced challenges, I knew I could rely on my instructors
            to offer guidance and support, making the learning process 
            smoother and more enjoyable.
                
            One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the TAI platform,
            dedicated to coding practice. This platform has been 
            instrumental in enhancing my programming skills. LMS at
            TAP Academy is another great asset. It centralizes all
            learning materials, assignments, and progress tracking 
            in one place. The dedicated job portal connects students
            with potential employers, offering a direct pathway to 
            internships and job placements. Through this portal, 
            I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional
             setting, which has been crucial for my career development.</pre>

        After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming
        skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved.
        Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL,
        HTML, and CSS in parallel.

        Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving
        skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the
        recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of frameworks
        like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
            
        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of
        Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.

        I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm
        happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. 
        They visited our college in Tamil Nadu and selected
        students for their CSR batch, offering a free course
        that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other 
        academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent 
        trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and 
        concise manner, start from scratch, making it easy for 
        beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of 
        programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placement 
        opportunities. 
        I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the 
        role of Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through 
        college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's 
        incredible teaching, as I used the same approach they taught me 
        during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy 
        offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS 
        platform with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing 
        daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock 
        assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as well 
        as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.
